# Racing Dreamer: Model-based Reinforcement Learning Improves Autonomous Racing Performance

![Racing Dreamer](docs/treitl_sim2real.gif)

This repository is organized as follows:
- Folder `dreamer` contains the code related to the Dreamer agent.
- Folder `modelfree` contains the code related to the Model Free algorihtms (D4PG, MPO, PPO, LSTM-PPO, SAC).
- Folder `hardware` contains the code related to the transfer on real racing cars.

* Folder `maps` contains a collection of several tracks to be used in [f1tenth](https://f1tenth.org/)-style races.
* Folder `mechanical` contains support material for real world race-tracks.
* Folder `ros_agent` contains the ROS interface to run the RL agent on a race car.
